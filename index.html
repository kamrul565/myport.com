         <p id="tribute-info">Lionel Andrés Messi[note 1] (Spanish
            pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi] (audio speaker
             iconlisten); born 24 June 1987), also known as Leo
              Messi, is an Argentine professional footballer who
               plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain
                and captains
            the Argentina national team. Often considered the
             best player in the world and widely regarded as one
              of the greatest players of all time.<br> Messi has
               won a record seven Ballon d'Or awards,[note 2] a
                record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 was
                 named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team. Until leaving
                 the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional
                  career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record
                   35 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven
                    Copa del Rey titles and four UEFA Champions Leagues. A prolific goalscorer
             and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records
              for most goals in La Liga (474), a La Liga and
               European league season (50), most hat-tricks
               in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (8),
               and most assists in La Liga (192), a La Liga season
                (21) and the Copa América (17). He also holds the
                 record for most international goals by a South
                  American male (80). Messi has scored over 750
                   senior career goals for club and country, and
                   has the most goals by a player for a single club. </p>
